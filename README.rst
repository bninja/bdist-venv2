bdist-venv2
===========

Implements a python distutils ``bdist_venv2`` command for creating a `virtualenv <https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv>`_ 
built distribution.

It was based on what was already done by:

- https://github.com/mgood/bdist_venv
    
but incorporates ideas from:

- https://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv
- http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/6/22/hate-hate-hate-everywhere

Install
-------

.. code:: bash

    sudo pip install bdist-venv2
    

Example
-------

Say you want to distribute a project called my-project. Get to its `setup.py`:

.. code:: bash

    cd ~/code/my-project/src
    ls
    ...
    setup.py
    ...

Make sure you are *not* in a virtualenv (you can't create a virtualenv from
within a virtualenv). If you in one exit it:

.. code:: bash

    deactivate

You can either create a "relocatable" virtualenv ala `bdist_venv <https://github.com/mgood/bdist_venv>`_:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py bdist_venv2 -f gztar
    
or one "fixed-up" to be unpacked to a particular location:

.. code:: bash

    python setup.py bdist_venv2 -l /usr/lib/my-package -f gztar

You'll find the results in ``dist`` which might look something like:

.. code:: bash

    ls dist
    ...
    dist/my-package-0.1.0.linux_x86_64-py2.7.tar.gz
    ...

depending on your environment.

-----

    python setup.py bdist_venv2 --help
